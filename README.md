# Predicting Influencer Income

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict influencer income based on:
- **Number of followers**
- **Engagement rate**
- **Number of posts per month**
- **Influencer niche** (lifestyle, gaming, fitness, tech)

By analyzing these factors, the model can estimate monthly income for influencers with reasonable accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Features
1. **Synthetic data generation**: Simulating realistic influencer data.
2. **Model training**: Using linear regression to learn relationships between input features and income.
3. **Visualization**: Comparing actual vs predicted influencer income using scatter plots.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Run each code cell step by step.
3. Check the results of the model and visualizations.
