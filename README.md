# Predicting Influencer Income

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict influencer income based on:
- **Number of followers**
- **Engagement rate**
- **Number of posts per month**
- **Influencer niche** (lifestyle, gaming, fitness, tech)

By analyzing these factors, the model can estimate monthly income for influencers with reasonable accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## Features
1. **Synthetic data generation**: Simulating realistic influencer data.
2. **Model training**: Using linear regression to learn relationships between input features and income.
3. **Visualization**: Comparing actual vs predicted influencer income using scatter plots.

---

## Results
- The model achieves a high \(R^2\) score, indicating a strong fit to the data.
- Example metrics:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** `X.XX`
  - **RÂ² Score:** `X.XX`
